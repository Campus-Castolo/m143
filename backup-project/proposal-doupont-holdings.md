    • Optimizing the Doupont Holdings Infrastructure and creating a plan for the optimized infrastructure.
    • Drafting a cost-estimation
    • The creation of a graphic that allows one to have a high-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • The Creation of a graphic that allows one to have a deep-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • Overseeing and leading the migration process
    • Documenting the migration process in form of a documentation.
    • Educating the inten IT-staff to the new changes
    • Maintaining and monitor the cloud enviornment for the adjustment period (approx. 4 Weeks)
