    Dear IMAM customer service team,

    We contact you, due to a deciscion we made last year during our annual management meeting. Together we have made the executive desicion that it would be more cost effective, to downscale our on-prem infrastructure and migrate to a cloud-based enviornment.

    Since this is a large scale project for us we have made a bulletlist of what needs to be done:

    • Analyzing the current state of the OrgInv Infrastructure
    • Optimizing the OrgInv Infrastructure and creating a plan for the optimized infrastructure.
    • Drafting a cost-estimation
    • The creation of a graphic that allows one to have a high-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • The Creation of a graphic that allows one to have a deep-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • Overseeing and leading the migration process
    • Documenting the migration process in form of a documentation.
    • Educating the inten IT-staff to the new changes
    • Maintaining and monitor the cloud enviornment for the adjustment period (approx. 4 Weeks)

    If you are interested in our job offer, kindly get in touch with us within 14 business days. Additionally, we kindly request that you provide us with a quota.


    Upon receiving your quota, we will assess your suitability as a candidate for our organization. We will then inform you of our decision and further details. Regardless of the outcome, we wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
