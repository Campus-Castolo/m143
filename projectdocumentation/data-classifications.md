# Doupont Holdings LLC - Data Classification Policy

## Purpose of this Document
This document serves the singular purpose of delineating comprehensive guidelines for the classification of data undergoing processing and/or storage within the purview of Doupont Holdings LLC, herein referred to as "DHLLC." The meticulous categorization of all data under the aegis of DHLLC is imperative to guarantee the preservation of sensitive information, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and thereby averting potential harm to DHLLC's esteemed reputation and its clientele.

## Scope
These guidelines are applicable to all DHLLC personnel, both internal and external, including individuals or entities contracted by DHLLC for data processing, whether their involvement pertains to specific or unspecific data. Adherence to this policy is obligatory for any data that DHLLC stores or processes. The task of overseeing compliance with these regulations falls under the purview of DHLLC's Compliance Department, which retains the authority to carry out unscheduled internal audits at its discretion. In circumstances necessitating external expertise, DHLLC's Compliance Department may engage external contractors. Violations of these compliance guidelines may result in penalties, termination of employment, or even instigation of legal actions by DHLLC against the transgressor.

## Internal Responsible Entity
DHLLC's Compliance Department and DHLLC's Data Management Department share the collective responsibility of vigilantly overseeing all activities pertaining to DHLLC's customer and internal data. This comprehensive oversight encompasses both external contractors and internal employees. It is crucial to emphasize that any infractions against the aforementioned policies will prompt immediate intervention by DHLLC's Compliance and Data Management Departments, without prior notice. The severity of the guideline violation will dictate the ensuing disciplinary actions.

## External Responsible Entity
All external entities and individuals contracted by DHLLC are under a strict obligation to adhere rigorously to the aforementioned guidelines. Furthermore, they must be fully prepared to provide an exhaustive report detailing their historical and ongoing work activities promptly upon request by either the DHLLC Compliance Department or the DHLLC Data Management Department.

It is imperative to emphasize that any breach of the compliance guidelines established by DHLLC will lead to not only reputational damage but also financial consequences for the external contractor. The nature and gravity of the guideline violation will determine the subsequent disciplinary actions taken.

- Data classified at this level is designated as internal and is accessible to all internal and external employees contracted by DHLLC, provided they possess the requisite clearance. Data at this level may make references to data at the DHLLC1-D - PUBLIC level, but it is essential to note that no content or data classified as DHLLC2-D INTERNAL should be present within the aforementioned data classification level.
- Data at this level may be stored within DHLLC's private and public cloud environments, provided that these environments meet the necessary security standards to ensure the data's safety.
